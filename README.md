# Nemuroid

## Description

Nemuroid is a specialized fork of the Lemuroid project, redesigned with a Nothing OS aesthetic. Lemuroid is an open-source emulation project for Android based on Libretro. This fork emphasizes a distinct visual identity inspired by Nothing's design language, featuring a custom UI, unique typography, and optimized interactions.

### UI Refinements (Nemuroid):
- **Nothing OS Aesthetics**: Redesigned UI components to match the Nothing OS look and feel.
- **Ndot Font Integration**: Native support for Ndot57 typography across game titles, system names, and navigation.
- **Floating Navigation Dock**: A custom, rounded-rectangular navigation bar positioned for easy access and modern aesthetics.
- **Refined Selection Indicators**: Sleek, focused highlights for a clean and intuitive user experience.
- **Monochrome Cartridge Overlay**: Game cards feature a simplified, monochrome cartridge-inspired design with white borders and system-specific pills.
- **Dot-Matrix Placeholders**: Loading states and missing covers feature a custom dot-matrix grid and Ndot initials.
- **Interactive Boot Animation**: A tactile "cartridge insertion" animation that triggers reactively as the game engine loads
- **Black and white themes**: It reads system information and uses a black or white theme
- **Gruvbox themes**: The app has an option to use the color tones of Gruvbox
It originated from a rib of [Retrograde](https://github.com/retrograde/retrograde-android), but graduated to a standalone project integrating [LibretroDroid](https://github.com/Swordfish90/LibretroDroid).
